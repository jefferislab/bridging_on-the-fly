# Bridging on-the-fly

**Bridging on-the-fly** is an online app that exposes some of the functionality of [nat](https://github.com/jefferis/nat) and [nat.flybrains](https://github.com/jefferislab/nat.flybrains) to allow visitors to bridge small numbers of neurons and other 3D data between different _Drosophila_ template brains without needing to download and install any code.


## Live demo
A live demo of this application is running at http://flybrain.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/si/bridging/on-the-fly/
